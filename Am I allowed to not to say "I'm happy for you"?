Turning on the showerhead, finally, I couldn't hold back any more. I tightly coverd my mouth with both hands in order to not cry loudly.
With the Adam's apple trambling uncontrollably, with swallowing the salty and humid air strongly, my tears then fell down mixed with hot water.

All because he told me that on Tuesday he is going on date with a girl we just knew last week. 
" I think she is interesting".

"But I love you". At one moment I almost spoke it out. But I am not allowed to.

He dosen't know, and I will never have a chance to say everything to him. Or, maybe, everything should be like this;
my feeling will eventually rot in the deepest place of my heart, becoming a scar that will never heal and will never be known.

Curse, fate, unrequited love, flying birds and fish.

Am I allowed to not to say "I'm happy for you" ?
