Turning on the shower head, finally I couldn't hold back any more. In order to not cry loudly, I tightly coverd my mouth with both hands, with the Adam's apple trambling uncontrollably, with swallowing the salty and humid air strongly. My tears then mixed with hot water fell down.

All because he told me that on Tuesday he is going on date with a girl we just knew last week. " I think she is interesting".

"But I love you". At one moment I almosted spoke it out. But I am not allowed to.

He dosen't know, and I will never have a chance to say everything to him. Or, maybe, everything should be like this; my feeling will eventually rot in the deepest place of my heart, becoming a scar that will never heal and will never be known.

Curse, fate, unrequited love, flying birds and fish.

Am I allowed to not to say "I'm happy for you" ?
